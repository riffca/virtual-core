  <div class="panel-body">
      <p>Secured communications will require certificates and keys. For example
      the LDAP server (which is the only container that is mandatory)
      will require one.</p>

      <p>Here you will have two alternatives:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>If you are testing this software or do not care about warnings
              about self-signed certificates, you will create your own
              Certificate Authority. Check the instructions below.</li>
          <li>You can use certificates from a recognized certificate authority.
          This is a longer process that might cost money. Check, for example:
          <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's encrypt</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      {% if run > 0 %}
      <div class="alert alert-danger">XXX</div>
      {% endif %}
      In order for this process to conclude you need to either:
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        <ul>

  </div>

<div class="panel panel-info">
    <div class="panel-heading">How to self-sign your own certificates</div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>You can either do this manually, see <a href="http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/185.html">the OpenLDAP FAQ entry on SSL (using certificates)</a>.</p>

      <p>Or you can use our CA creation wizard. Note that this is mostly for testing. You should review our security infrastructure carefuly.</p>
